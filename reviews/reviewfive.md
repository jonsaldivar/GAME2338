## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Your location is Seatel and your name is Randel Wanye who is suffering some kind of amnesia and is in search of his lost wife and daughter. The game is in a gloomy stlye with a grungy comicbook look. The music is great and really goes with this gloomy mood set up by the game. This dark gridy game takes place during a zombie apocolyse and your means of survival is in a axe you find early on and a few guns and lastly your wits. The cutscences are comicstrips that are done really well and help emphasis the story with voice overs not losing anything due to the lack of actual motion.

The gameplay can be fast but slow at times when you need to figure out a puzzle or deal with enimes. I feel like the game puts emphasis of trying to survive by avoidng danger then killing everything you come across. A reason I say this is due to one of the mechanics in the game where you can stand on a platform out of reach of the zombies an whistle drawing them near allowing the player to jump ovver them and aviod the threat altogerther. The combat is gridy and satifieing, the controls feel good in the hand, very responsive.


## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.

Overall the gaem was a fun experince but the jumping in the probly needs to be teaed alittle more to be better there was sections where I had to retry the jump several times in a row till I finally made it. Another section where you go underground and try and get through a whole bunch of traps felt tacked on because it just kept going on and on. Another part that I found annoying was the fact that the player doesnt know how to swim but wasnt shown in a beliveable way dying in water in tiny pits that were only an inch deeper then you are tall, really ruined the emersion due to being a survival game where you outrun a helicoper shooting you.
