## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Your location is Seatel and your name is Randel Wanye who is suffering some kind of amnesia and is in search of his lost wife an daughter. The art style is a gloomy stlye with a grungy comicbook style. The music is great and really goes with this gllomy mood set up by the game. This dark gridy game takes place during a zombie apocolyse and your means of survival is a (melee weapon) a few guns and your wits.
The cutscences are comicstrips that are done really well and help emphasis the story with voice overs not losing anything due to the lack of actual motion.


## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
