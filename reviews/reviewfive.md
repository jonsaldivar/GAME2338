## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Your location is Seatel and your name is Randel Wanye who ois suffering some kind of amnesia and is in search of his lost wife an ddaughter. 

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
