## Summary

Your location is Seattle and your name is Randel Wayne who is suffering some kind of amnesia and is in search of his lost wife and daughter. The game is in a gloomy style with a grungy comic book look. The music is great and really goes with this gloomy mood set up by the game. This dark gridy game takes place during a zombie apocalypse and your means of survival is in a axe you find early on and a few guns and lastly your wits. The cut scenes are comic strips that are done really well and help emphasis the story with voice overs not losing anything due to the lack of actual motion.

For mechanics you can use your weapons or body as a way to unlock other areas or secrets. If you give yourself a running charge you can ram through a door. Another mechanic is the stamina bar which keeps you mindful of your actions swinging and sprinting too much or unnecessarily near zombies can leave you wide open for an attack. But not is all lost because if you do get grabbed you are able to break yourself free but if you get swarmed your good as dead.

The gameplay can be fast but slow at times when you need to figure out a puzzle or deal with enemies. I feel like the game puts emphasis of trying to survive by avoiding danger then killing everything you come across. A reason I say this is due to one of the mechanics in the game where you can stand on a platform out of reach of the zombies an whistle, drawing them near allowing the player to jump over them and avoid the threat altogether. Another reason is you’re not superman, if you get sandwiched between 2 zombies your character is not fast enough to get away.  The combat is gridy and satisfying, the controls feel good in the hand, very responsive.



## Final Thoughts

Overall the game was a fun experience but the jumping in the probably needs to be tweaked a little more to be better there was sections where I had to retry the jump several times in a row till I finally made it. Another section where you go underground and try and get through a whole bunch of traps felt tacked on because it just kept going on and on. Another part that I found annoying was the fact that the player doesn’t know how to swim but wasn’t shown in a believable way dying in water in tiny pits that were only an inch deeper then you are tall, really ruined the emersion due to being a survival game where you outrun a helicopter shooting you.
