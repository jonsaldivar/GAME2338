## Summary

In Super Mario bros you play as a man dressed as a plumber named Mario, who runs around in a colorful world chasing and fighting a giant turtle with spikes on his back because he kidnapped the princess of your kingdom. You eat magical mushrooms and fantastical flowers to give yourself different powers. Saving the toadstools that inhabit the world as you go along.

Super Mario bros is a 2D side scrolling platformer were you run to the right of the screen avoiding little brown furry mushrooms either jumping on them or over. The main goal of the game is to rescue the princess traversing through several areas in your search to find her. Coming to a head to head battle in the hopes of defeating Bowser and rescuing his captor at the end of each level.

The game allows you one hit before its game over, but one mechanic is the mushroom power up which makes you larger which allows you to get hit once more before dying. Overall you start off the game with three lives but you can earn more buy collecting 100 coins or finding a secret one up mushroom. A flashing flower gives Mario the ability to throw fireballs and as well as a sparkling star which grants you invincibility.

## Final Thoughts

Overall the game is fun it can be challenging at times but to simplicity of the levels, controls and easy to understand mechanics donâ€™t let a section stay difficult for long. The easy to pick up accessibility make it an easy game to enjoy for anyone with iconic music and unforgettable art. What I didnt like was that the boss fights seem repetitve.
