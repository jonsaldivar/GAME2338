## Summary
The game LIMBO takes place, well in limbo at least that is what can be assumed by the lack of color and hospitality in the surrounding area. LIMBO is a 2D physics based platformer were you take control of a little boy who we can presumed is dead and is searching for his little sister. The gameplay is based on traversing though this dangerous world in the hopes of being reunited with her. The simplicity of the art, a silhouette style with contrasting colors of black and white with soft tonal greys as backgrounds really help let the character and environment pop. 

One thing you will find yourself doing a lot is dying and surprisingly not always due to the difficultly. The developers put so much care in making each death unique that you might just find yourself curious at times to see how they created the death scenes for each puzzle. There seems to be a big emphasis on death and I think thatâ€™s due to the tone of the game there is rotting corpses of children scattered randomly through the world. The gameplay is simple but can be challenging at times  

Another thing you will find is that there is a lack of story but, I dont think thats totally a bad thing. It allows the player to speculate on the where abouts of the main character and how he and his sister got there. Sometimes its nice to not have a story presented to you and gives you to the ability to fill in the gaps yourself.

## Final Thoughts
The game is a little short but the challenges really help buffer out the playtime. The simple mechanics and minimalist art style really make the game very approachable for more casual players. The physic based puzzles can be a little frustrating at times but feel very rewarded once you figure them out.
