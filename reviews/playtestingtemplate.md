**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ No, I did have a general idea due to the nature of the animal you play, but mechanically I wasn’t exactly sure what the end goal was.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?

> _Answer:_ After 15 minutes of trial and error, it was fun.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
