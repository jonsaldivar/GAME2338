## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Fable Anniversary takes place in a medievial Fanasty setting where you are a boy who's village is pillaged and his family murdered. Due to your sisters dreams she is able to give you a warning and tells you to hide. You now all alone are saved and rescued by a mage character called Maze and raised in a guild of fighters, here you start off your journey.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
