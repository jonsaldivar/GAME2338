## Summary

Fable Anniversary takes place in a medievial Fanasty setting where you are a boy who's village is pillaged and his family murdered. Due to your sisters dreams she is able to give you a warning and tells you to hide. You, now all alone are saved and rescued by a mage character called Maze and raised in a guild of fighters, here you start off your journey. 

The game takes place in a 3rd person veiw and gives you an option of 3 different combat types: melee, range, and spellcasting. Each allowing a differnet play style, but the good thing is you are not locked into only one style. You can choose to use all three if you want leveling them up and unlocking spells. The freedom of choice allows the player a ton of replay ability.

The main mechanic for Fable Anniversary is that there is a moral system in place, you can be pure evil or pure angelic or anything inbetween. Its a really cool feature and not to many games of the time did this. By killing evil doers you are rewarded with good karma points but if you hit or kill ciztezens you are given bad karma points as well with stealing and breaking property.

Flowing off the karma mechanic what also made it a cool feature is the added effect it has on your apperance which was also a big factor in the game.  For Example, if you chose to be angelic you gained a white glow and a halo above your head allowing NPC's in your visinity to run up to you just wanting to be in your presence. Vice versa you grew huge devil horns the more evil you where, scaring off villagers and townsfolk and leaving crying children in your wake with your presence alone. Losing a fight or getting heavily damaged also effected your apperence leaving a scare that showed off your loses.

## Final Thoughts

The moral system was a really cool feature and helped make your character look unique as well as the choices of combat styles allowed for different ways of approaching a situation. But I didnt like the combat targeting system which was very clunky. Due to the moral system in the game you are able to select anyone as a target but if you want to be as good as possible it can be a little tricky. In combat if there are cizvilians or alleies near by and you try to switch targets you can target the wrong person and because your in the heat of battle you might hit them 1-2 times before relizeing your attacking the wrong target and cominting an evil act. Prolonging the time it would take you to max out your pure good karma. As well as making the combat more difficult and less responseive then it needed to be.
