## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Fable Anniversary takes place in a medievial Fanasty setting where you are a boy who's village is pillaged and his family murdered.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.

I didnt like the combat targeting system is was very clunky. Due to the moral system in the game you are able to select anyone as a target but if you want to be as good as possible it can be a little tricky if there are cizvilians or alleies near by as when you try to switch targrts you can target the wrong person and because your in the heat of battle you might hit them 1-2 times before you relize your doing an evil act.
