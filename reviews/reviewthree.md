Qube 2 is a platforming puzzler that takes place on another planet. Having played the first one I noticed a lot has changed for the better. The graphics have been improved upon immensely now graphic arenâ€™t everything but they help and Qube 2 is no exception, graphically the game looks amazing. Most of the 45 mins that I played was inside where the layout was minimalist but the attention to detail on the wires and blocks that surround you were shown a lot of care. The use of light was spot on having a high contrast of light and shadow giving the world a depth that was visually appealing. The few times I was show the sky was either a beautiful light blue sky with red trees on this alien planet or a harsh unforgiving red sand storm as if I was on mars.
