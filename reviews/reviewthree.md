## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

Q.U.B.E. 2 is a platforming puzzler that takes place on another planet. Having played the first one I noticed a lot has changed for the better. The graphics have been improved upon immensely! Now graphics arenâ€™t everything but they help and Qube 2 is no exception, graphically the game looks amazing. Most of the 45 minutes that I played was inside where the layout was minimalist but the attention to detail on the wires and blocks that surround you were shown a lot of care. The use of light was spot on having a high contrast of light and shadow giving the world a depth that was visually appealing. The few times I was shown the sky was either a beautiful light blue sky with red trees on this alien planet or a harsh unforgiving red sand storm as if I was on mars.

You start off the game waking up from qrio sleep and with a bad case of amneisa and you are spoken to by a woman who tells you about the alien invasion that took place years ago that was stopped by a brave hero (You from Q.U.B.E.) and now must be done again. By finding the enimes weak point and destroy them. 

The mechanics for this game are simplistic but are done in a way that just flows. I played the game for 45 minutes straight having a blast not wanting to put the controller down. Just like the first game I belive the sequal was heavily inspired by portal which almost feels like a spin off more so this one then Q.U.B.E.. And if you like that time of play style I can fully reccomend Q.U.B.E. 2.  Your tool that has been provided to you is a glove that can munipulate specificly blank squares and change them to a desired coller, blue, red, green, and yellow. Each being unlocked after you learn the basics of the current colorThe blue squares allow you the ability to bounce off of them giving you more then enough air to get past your ostacle. The red squres can be turned into platforms using it as a makeshift platform or other means. The green power gives you the abilty to spawn a cube that cant be moved. The yellow square I have yet to unock.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.

I had so much fun with this game the puzzle mechanics, graphics, the world, atomsphere, and even the story telling. I found the sequael to be very refreshing and actually beliveable. The first game just felt like a bunch of actual puzzles so using it as a premis to explore an alien ship made no sense but the newely designed puzzle mecanics really fit in this made up world with the swift movement and great controls. I really am trying to see something that im not liking but I just cant, Im sure if someoneelse reviewed this gaem could find something wrong with it but I cant.
