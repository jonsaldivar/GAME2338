## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

- The first level starts you off on a beach giving you the only option to go forward but has boxes fall and block your path the prompt of a controller telling you to walk backwards teaches you the mechanic of the game and what the rest of the gaem will entail. You are given the pwer to manipulate time and the mear fact of walking forward or backwards kicks you powers into motion.

The Gardens take place in a preteens life where they are in the action of moving and in the mits of losing a friend they reminest over the memories each item has. This is a 2D onrails side scroller mixed with 3D levels. The Gardens is a very simplistic, artsy, puzzle game that has some real head scratchers that'll make you put down the controller and pick it up at a later time when your mind is refreshed.

The mecanic of the game is time, as a onrails side scroller each step that you take forward progress time as if you are holding the play button on a tv remote. As you can presume walking backwards rewinds time, these features alone could make a great game ie prince of persia but since this is a onrails game it plays differently. As time progress so does the enviroment moving and breathing with the player. In the earlier levels this seems to be the only mechanic and starts feel like itll be an easy game.

But in that moment of delusion the next level includes 

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
