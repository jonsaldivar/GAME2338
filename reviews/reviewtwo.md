## Summary

- The first level starts you off on a beach giving you the only option to go forward but has boxes fall and block your path the prompt of a controller telling you to walk backwards teaches you the mechanic of the game and what the rest of the game will entail. You are given the power to manipulate time and the mere fact of walking forward or backwards kicks you powers into motion.

The Gardens take place in a preteens life where they are in the action of moving and in the midst of losing a close friend. You traverse through their memories as they reminisce. This is a 2D on-rails side-scroller mixed with 3D levels. The Gardens is a very simplistic, artsy, puzzle game that has some real head scratchers that'll make you put down the controller and pick it up at a later time when your mind is refreshed.

The mechanic of the game is time, as an on-rails side-scroller each step that you take forward progress time as if you are holding the play button on a TV remote. As you can presume walking backwards rewinds time, these features alone could make a great game i.e. prince of Persia but since this is an on-rails game it plays differently. As time progress so does the environment moving and breathing with the player.

## Final Thoughts

- The game is awesome and fun it’s a little slow, but if you love games I don’t think that would bother you at all. The only critique that I can give is a real knit pick. I don’t necessarily think it’s bad but I would like to see if my assumptions of the story are right or way off the mark. The game has no dialogue what so ever and I’m about 85% done with the game, so I don’t except to hear any in the last 15%. I guess a better critique would be the difficulty it is a fun brain teaser but you can see that the developer tries to trip you up but if you play a lot of games you kind of catch on how to play a level in under 5 minutes. An upside to the game is that it has about 12 levels and around 2-3 sublevels in each, bulking up the game. The art and dream like atmosphere is very calming and inviting making for a fun relaxing brain teaser to blaze through.
