## Summary

From what I got from playing the game you play as a green man that is in a band, a one man band that is. It has an Italian feel to it so you might be in the streets of Italy. For now the whole of the game seems to be up for interpretation so for me the goal is for you to try and earn enough money either to survive or to afford a passport out of there.

Mechanically there’s a few selections in the types of music you can create. There are no instructions and the developer seems to just leave you to your own devices. Allowing for experimentation and freedom to learn and teach yourself the instruments. At first I was confused not knowing what anything did but after pressing randomly on the screen I was able to make out the simple controls. The game doesn’t hold your hand and turns up the expected time invested the deeper you go.

They start you off easy by having the drums beats the only visible option on screen at first with the least amount of beats. After you feel like you understand that, at least for me I started to experiment some more and found that there was a drop down window that allowed for more instruments. Two other instruments are given which is the harmonica and the banjo. Both instruments give you a higher amount of selection of rhythms possible, almost as if raising the difficultly.


## Final Thoughts
The game definitely has potential but mechanically there isn’t much, but what is there can be fun if you choose to stick around and spend some time trying to recreate your favorite songs or creating new one.
